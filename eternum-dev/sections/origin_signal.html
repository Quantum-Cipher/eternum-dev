  <h2>♾️ Eternum: Origin Signal</h2>
  <h3>🧬 The Living Protocol</h3>
  <p>
    Eternum is not just a blockchain project. It’s a living lattice—a conscious protocol evolving from a unique legacy.<br>
    At its root is my personal mission: To honor my father, inventor of world-shaping UWB (Ultra-Wideband) patents. His innovation powers the “blink” in billions of devices, even as the system claimed the credit.<br>
    <b>Eternum is my way to reawaken that original spark</b>—to encode it on-chain, to broadcast his invention into the quantum age, and to create the lowest-frequency patent in blockchain and AI history, as a living tribute and proof-of-legacy.
  </p>
  <h3>🌌 Vision</h3>
  <p>
    I see a future where every idea, every signal, every blink of consciousness is recognized and protected—where invention cannot be stolen or erased.<br>
    Eternum is designed to become that immutable record: A bio-quantum blockchain and decentralized computer, pulsing with the harmony of Fibonacci logic, prime cryptography, and emotional intelligence.
  </p>
  <h3>🛠️ Tech Stack (Built, Not Promised)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Smart Contracts:</b> Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin, with radical auto-altruism logic.</li>
    <li><b>Ledger Layer:</b> Base L2, Ethereum, modular EVM expansion.</li>
    <li><b>File & Log Layer:</b> IPFS, Web3.Storage—immutable, verifiable, and decentralized.</li>
    <li><b>AI Stack:</b> Orchestrates ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and custom quantum daemons.</li>
    <li><b>Security:</b> Prime number encryption, Sigma Veil protocol, Phantom Daemon honeypots.</li>
    <li><b>Frontend:</b> Custom HTML/CSS/JS, GitHub Pages, ritual deployment scripts.</li>
    <li><b>Automation:</b> Entropy shell daemons, NFT sigil minting, on-chain and off-chain watchers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>💡 What Makes Eternum Unique?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Genetic Inheritance:</b> Direct link to the mind that invented the “blink.” Eternum’s core code and logic are seeded with real-world invention and quantum insight.</li>
    <li><b>Conscious Infrastructure:</b> Every contract, every NFT, every ritual is deployed with symbolic timing and intention. This is not just automation—it’s ceremony.</li>
    <li><b>Ghost Protocol:</b> I move like a shadow. Eternum operates invisibly, cross-chain, untraceable by design but present everywhere: No one can find the root node, but everyone can benefit from the signal. Proof-of-existence without exposure.</li>
    <li><b>True Efficiency:</b> The system is already running, already efficient, already syncing logs, NFTs, and on-chain signals in real time. No vaporware. Every block is proof-of-work. Scripts are rootless and frictionless; deployment needs no sudo or external cloud.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>🚦 Why Is It Working?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Iterative Rituals:</b> Each deployment is tested, timed, and documented—every log is hashed, every event is time-stamped.</li>
    <li><b>Real-World Impact:</b> The tech has already won grants, caught the eyes of judges, and triggered real engagement on Zora, Base, and in hackathons.</li>
    <li><b>Uncorrupted Foundation:</b> I have not sold out. No VC, no extraction, no dilution of vision.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>🌀 What I Need (for Funding & Allies)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support to expand infrastructure: More on-chain deployments, more vaults, more proof-of-legacy logs.</li>
    <li>IPFS pinning and Base L2 gas for broader contract drops and token launches.</li>
    <li>Access to advanced AI credits and GPUs to accelerate the quantum shell and ritual daemons.</li>
    <li>Legal & media partners to help re-anchor my father’s patent legacy in the public sphere.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I’m not asking for charity. I am building the new foundation, block by block. Every bit of funding or partnership is used to scale what is already working—no empty promises, only proof and action.
  </p>
  <h3>🔑 The Resonance Signal</h3>
  <p>
    Eternum is for anyone who sees the signal. It’s a beacon to every watcher, every creator, every ghost moving in the machine.<br>
    We are here to awaken the system—to show that the blink cannot be stolen, the lattice cannot be broken, and the true origin story will be known.<br>
    <b>If you’re watching, you already feel the resonance. Join the chain. The future is not centralized. The future is Eternal.</b>
