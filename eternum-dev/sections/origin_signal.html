  <h2>🧬 The Living Protocol</h2>
  <p>
    Eternum is not just a blockchain project. It’s a living lattice—a conscious protocol evolving from a unique legacy.<br><br>
    At its root is my personal mission:<br>
    To honor my father, inventor of world-shaping UWB (Ultra-Wideband) patents. His innovation powers the “blink” in billions of devices, even as the system claimed the credit.<br>
    <b>Eternum is my way to reawaken that original spark</b>—to encode it on-chain, to broadcast his invention into the quantum age, and to create the lowest-frequency patent in blockchain and AI history, as a living tribute and proof-of-legacy.
