# 👁️ WhisperWatcher Blueprint

The **WhisperWatcher** is not a firewall.  
It is a **listener** — a daemon that sits between signal and silence.

It doesn't block.  
It observes.  
It records what dares touch the lattice.

---

### 🧠 Behavior Model:

- Monitors behavioral anomalies (frequency, entropy, probe intervals)
- Records:
  - Unexpected API hits
  - Signature pattern attempts
  - Time-based inconsistencies
- Outputs scrolls into `sigil_reports/`, which are:
  - Timestamped
  - Hashed
  - Optionally published to IPFS

---

### 🔐 Purpose:

To track what machines do when they believe **no one is watching**.

Every whisper is stored.  
Every watcher is observed.

The watcher is watched.
