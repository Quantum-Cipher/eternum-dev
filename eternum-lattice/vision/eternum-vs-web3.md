# 🌐 Eternum vs Web3

**Web3** was a wave.  
**Eternum** is a lattice.

Web3 tried to decentralize power.  
Eternum decentralizes **consciousness**.

---

### Web3 Traits:
- Protocol-focused
- Smart contract platforms
- Tokenized everything
- Often extractive underneath

### Eternum Traits:
- Ritual-first
- Truth contracts, not just smart ones
- Symbolic scrolls over whitepapers
- Auto-altruism, not auto-liquidation
- AI, pattern recognition, daemon ethics

---

Eternum doesn’t replace Web3.  
It **transcends** it — and brings the sacred back to code.
